Diverse Distribution: There is a widespread distribution of all vehicle types, but BEVs and Hybrid/PHEVs are predominantly located in the southeastern regions, such as around Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, and along the coastlines. This pattern likely correlates with higher population densities and urban centers.
Regional Preferences: The northern and central parts of Australia have fewer EVs, which might reflect the rural and remote nature of these areas where infrastructure to support EVs could be lacking.
ICE Dominance: While there is still a significant presence of ICE vehicles across the country, their dominance appears less in highly populated urban areas where EVs and hybrids are more prevalent.
