Concentration in Urban Areas: There is a high concentration of charging stations in the southeastern parts of Australia, notably around major cities such as Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. This corresponds with higher EV adoption in these areas.
Sparse Rural Coverage: The central and northern regions have fewer charging stations, which might discourage EV ownership in these areas due to range anxiety and the lack of infrastructure.
Coastal Access: Charging stations are more prevalent along the coastlines, facilitating long-distance travel along these routes.
