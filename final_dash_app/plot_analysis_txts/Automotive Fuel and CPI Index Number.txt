Both the Automotive Fuel Index (red line) and the CPI Index (blue line) have generally increased over time, likely due to inflation. This means both the cost of fuel and general consumer prices have risen since 1972.
The rate of increase appears to be higher for the Automotive Fuel Index compared to the CPI Index. The steeper slope of the red line suggests that fuel prices may have risen faster than overall inflation.
There seems to be some fluctuation in the Automotive Fuel Index, with periods of steeper increase followed by periods of slower growth or even slight decrease. This suggests fuel prices may experience volatile swings over time.
