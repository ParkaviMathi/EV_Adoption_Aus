Underutilized Potential: High-income areas with low EV registrations suggest a potential market for increasing EV adoption. These areas might not yet have the infrastructure or incentives that encourage EV ownership.
Barriers to Adoption: The presence of high-income yet low EV adoption areas could point to non-financial barriers such as limited access to charging infrastructure, lack of awareness, or preference for traditional vehicles.
Urban and Regional Differences: The distribution shows that even within high-income brackets, the adoption of EVs varies significantly, possibly influenced by local policies or the availability of EV-friendly infrastructure.
