Trend Analysis: 
BEVs: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) show a significant upward trend, especially post-2020, indicating rapidly growing adoption.
PHEVs: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have a steady but slower growth compared to BEVs, reflecting consistent but cautious consumer adoption.
FCEVs: Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) have minimal registrations, suggesting they are not yet widely adopted or available in Australia.
Market Shift: The sharp increase in BEV registrations post-2020 suggests a market shift towards fully electric options, possibly driven by improvements in infrastructure, technology, and consumer preference.
Policy and Incentives: The growth in BEV sales might correlate with government incentives, regulatory support, or increased awareness of environmental benefits.
Technology Influence: Advancements in BEV technology, such as improved range and decreased cost, could be driving their rapid adoption.
Economic and Environmental Factors: Economic conditions and environmental concerns likely play a significant role in the choice of powertrain, with BEVs becoming more appealing due to lower long-term operational costs and zero emissions.
Future Projections: If current trends continue, BEVs may dominate the market, potentially outpacing hybrids and other technologies as infrastructure and technology further evolve.
